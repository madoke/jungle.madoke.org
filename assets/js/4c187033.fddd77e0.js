Modern product teams often include people from different cultures and countries, and they're not exclusively made of software engineers anymore: UX, design and product are essential skills that the team needs in order to be complete. Teams are more diverse, each of us has different expectations, and for the tech lead, the challenge is to establish a common culture and mindset that allows everyone to be coherent and aligned. Conflict is part of human nature but on the other side, history proves that given the proper conditions and motivation, we can adapt to pretty much everything.

Every start is a brand new one, so don't ignore the importance of building trust within a group that doesn't know you. This has been my approach on every team that I've joined so far, both as tech lead and developer, and it is one of the hardest things to get because it will take time, experience, and a significant deal of humility.\nThis should be one of your main goals as a lead engineer, and in my opinion, one that will make the difference.

Again, because we are all humans, there will be different opinions.

This becomes impractical to execute on every single decision, given that you will have other people around like product and engineering managers poking you with dates, but it is something that you should always do whenever possible.

Making decisions as a team is vital, and will give everyone a sense of ownership and motivation that they will not have if you design everything alone. However, group decisions are more expensive, so it is impossible to decide everything together. I didn't yet succeed in finding the perfect setup for decision making in a team, and currently the approach I find correct is to make team decisions as much as possible using the sprint spikes, and delegate individual decisions to appointed team members depending on the project. Using this approach, the role of the leader is just to assist others in the decision making process, and making sure that every decision is presented to the team and documented"),Object(i.b)("h2",{id:"mentoring-by-delegation"},"Mentoring by delegation"),Object(i.b)(s.a,{src:h,sourceName:"Unsplash",authorName:"Nadir sYzYgY",imageName:"Mentoring",imageUrl:"https://unsplash.com/photos/den6gTowZKs",mdxType:"ImageWithAttribution"}),Object(i.b)("p",null,"Following the line of thought in the previous conclusion, this is probably the second most important goal that you should chase as a tech lead. It didn't strike me at first, and as a consequence, on early days, my teams were heavily dependent on me because I simply filled in the gaps for everyone. If the team is presenting results and meeting deadlines you probably won't notice immediately, but the signs are there, productivity drops when you're off or unavailable, complex tasks start to pile up, and the team is not able to scale nor respond to pressure.\nIt can be very tempting to step in and help out the team to give that final push and deliver the project, but when this starts to be the norm, then you're already in trouble. The team needs to be able to work without you, and the main focus of your work should not be to deliver an assessment for everything or building the perfect architecture, but giving your team the tools to be able to do it without you. From the moment you start your role as a tech lead, you should try to make yourself obsolete. And you do that by mentoring, organising, documenting, delegating.\nBuilding an autonomous team is a hard process, and it will take you a lot of time, repetition and perseverance. My current approach is to do small improvements to the team's autonomy on every task that comes to me by asking the same question every time: How would the team do this if I was not here ? And the answer pretty much depends on the situation. It might be writing a tutorial/documentation, it might be pair programming with someone, it might be reviewing someone's code and pointing out the details, or ultimately it might be delegating smaller bits of leadership to other team members (by project for example) while overseeing everything from above. In order for you to be successful, the engineering manager should share this mindset with you and help you out on a daily basis, so make sure that you always keep him onboard."),Object(i.b)("h2",{id:"leaving-no-man-behind"},"Leaving no man behind"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"From the moment we understood that we needed to hunt in groups in order to survive, we developed a tribal culture that is present pretty much everywhere in today's society like for example in football, religion, music genres, countries or, not surprisingly, engineering teams.\nWhen taken with moderation, a bit of rivalry and competition between teams is good for the organisation, but what's really important is that your team members feel a part of the team, and are willing to do the best job possible to represent it. This goes back to the motivation subject, but my point here is that you should make everyone feel represented and comfortable enough to make mistakes. It's not a question of if, but rather a question of when will your team make a mistake (we're humans, remember ?) which will have consequences for the outside environment, which can potentially be a customer or other team.\nThese are the moments where good organisations will demand an explanation of what happened, why it happened and how will your team fix it. This kind of scrutiny is crucial for improving the company, and the team, but if not done properly it can be damaging to the team members and consequently to the team.
