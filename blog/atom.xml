        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3 years have passed since I became a lead software engineer (or tech lead) and it's been a challenging run with many achievements and pitfalls. In this article, I try to synthesise what I think are the most important lessons I learned so far in this journey, hoping that they will be useful to other lead engineers who are trying to perform better in their craft. Having led a couple of teams until now, I still have a lot to learn, but I certainly do approach things in a different way than I did some years ago, and the results present themselves in the most unexpected ways. There’s no secret formula to improve your leadership capabilities, It's a learning process pretty much like working with a new language or framework. I started off by reading some blogs and books, but the greatest lessons actually came from trial and error, and constructive feedback from others.]]></summary>
