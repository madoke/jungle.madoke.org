## About me

I'm a software engineer based in Lisbon, with experience in the media and telco industries. Currently I'm a tech lead at [Truphone](https://truphone.com) where my responsibility is to build capable engineering teams and scalable system architectures.

Outside work I'm pushing it hard to be a cool father that plays video games, builds legos, contributes to open-source, side projects and ocasionally does some outdoor activity like trail running.

## About this page

It's a small resume, which I also use to experiment with some stuff like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). It also contains a [blog](/blog), where I share some of my thoughts and opinions on software engineering and life in general.

## What I've been up to

Below is a TL/DR of my professional experience, with a couple of highlights on every role I've had so far

### Tech Lead @ [Truphone](https://www.truphone.com)

- Mentoring and onboarding software engineers. As a tech lead, this is one of my main activities, to make sure that everyone in the team has the right tools to do their job, as well as guiding the group in the direction that we believe is the best, both in terms of strategy and technology;

- Designing and building system architectures for the [Connect](https://www.truphone.com/connect/), [Things](https://www.truphone.com/things/) and [My Truphone](https://www.truphone.com/consumer/) products, aligning them with the overall engineering strategy for the company, by coordinating with other teams and higher ranked stakeholders like principals and heads;

- Writing software for all the products mentioned above, mostly microservices in Java 11, Node and Golang, as well as mobile and web apps in React/React Native;

- Maintaining and resurrecting a legacy monolith in Python/Django/MySQL that grew in terms of users and needed to be adapted for scalability while maintaining an acceptable service level to the already existing customers;

- Agile process assistance by leading SCRUM Ceremonies, preparing backlog, coaching the team in processes like estimations, retrospectives, spikes, demos etc;

### Developer @ [Sky](https://www.sky.uk)

- Writing Java 8 REST micro-services using CentOS severs, MySQL and Cassandra for persistency, Graphite + Grafana for monitoring, and ELK stack for logging;

- Building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using Groovy to orchestrate Jenkins tasks, Gradle to perform build, analysis and testing, and Python + Puppet for application deploys;

- Containerizing existing services and migrating to Kubernetes, which included building functional Docker images, creating the k8s deployments and integrating them with the existing CI/CD pipelines;

### Developer @ [Grupo Impresa](https://www.impresa.pt)

- Develop and maintain a media content platform for newsrooms with a set of Java micro-services using Jersey (REST) or Apache Thrift and plain Java with PostgreSQL for the persistence layer;

- Building a wide range of media websites and for all the group's magazines, newspapers and tv channels on top of the content platform, using PHP/jQuery (Web) and Objective-C (iOS);

- Migrating content from legacy platforms/websites using automated processes which allowed the journalists to transition to new content backoffice and websites, with minimal impact on the regular newsroom activity and website availability;

- Team leadership assistance by mentoring and onboarding junior developers and internal delivery management for specific projects;
