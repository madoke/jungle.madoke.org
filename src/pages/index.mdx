I work as a Software Engineer at [Truphone](https://truphone.com), where i'm in the technical lead for the [Connect](https://truphone.com/connect) team. With experience on all parts of the stack, infrastructure and architecture, my career is mostly technical, and I intend to keep pushing it in that direction.

I started working in IT after graduating from [Instituto Superior Tecnico](https://ist.ul.pt) in 2010 and have been doing that since. Before my current job i worked in the media industry at [Grupo Impresa](https://www.impresa.pt) and [Sky Technology Centre](https://sky.co.uk) mostly designing and developing backends and witnessing the transition from big deployable monoliths and traditional IT teams to microservices, containers and devops. After joining Truphone I led the [My Truphone](https://www.truphone.com/consumer) team for a couple of years after which I left to build my current team.

Apart from my professional activities i like to work on side projects and contribute to open source. I also do some road and trail running, play video games and invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies.
