Hello ! my name is David and I'm a Software Engineer. I specialize in backend systems but also have experience with full stack. Most of my career has circled around building microservices, web apps and deconstructing or stabilizing legacy monoliths.

I'm based in Oeiras, Lisbon and I'm currently working in the crypto asset and web3 sector, as a senior backend developer at [Moonpay](https://moonpay.com). Previously I've been in the telecom industry at [Truphone](https://www.truphone.com/) where I did architecture and engineering leadership. I've also worked in the media industry for some years as a backend developer, at [Sky](https://www.sky.com/) and [Grupo Impresa](https://www.impresa.pt).

Outside work, I play video games, build legos, contribute to a couple of side projects and occasionally do some outdoor activity like trail running. I'm also interested in motorsport (mostly formula 1) and the crypto asset industry.
