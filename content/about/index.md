Hello ! my name is David and I'm a Software Engineer. I specialize in backend systems but also have experience with full stack. Most of my career has circled around building microservices, web apps and deconstructing or stabilizing legacy monoliths.

I'm based in Oeiras, Lisbon) I'm currently a Staff Engineer at [Truphone](https://www.truphone.com/) where I do mostly architecture across a couple of teams. Prior to my current role I've worked as a Tech Lead, doing similar work but on a smaller scale. Before Truphone, I worked as a backend Software Developer in the media industry for some years, at [Sky](https://www.sky.com/) and [Grupo Impresa](https://www.impresa.pt).

Outside work I'm a father who plays video games, builds legos, contributes to a couple of side projects and occasionally does some outdoor activity like trail running. I'm also interested in motorsport (mostly formula 1) and the crypto asset industry.
