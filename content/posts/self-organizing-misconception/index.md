Tech startups are good examples of productivity. With small teams on limited resources, every member usually exercises multiple competencies from engineering to product and leadership. While this is in most cases not an option, it creates a positive outcome of high accountability and alignment with the companyt's mission. The ones that succeed and need to scale will most likely at some point struggle to maintain this cohesion and control the chaos that naturally comes with more people onboard.

Scaling up is a painful and uncertain process, which is why, with no surprise, most organization models we see in scale-ups try to mimic the best practices and success stories from other companies that already walked the same runway. [Spotify squads](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/) and [Amazon 2-Pizza teams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/two-pizza-teams.html?utm_source=madoke.org), two of the most popular role models, were discussed in every company I've worked for the past 6-7 years, alongside with [Google SRE book](https://sre.google/workbook/how-sre-relates/) and [Airbnb engineering culture](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/engineering-culture-at-airbnb-345797c17cbe?utm_source=madoke.org). These 4 companies alone were likely to have influenced most engineering organizations around the world, which is probably one of the reasons we're solving similar problems everywhere.

In a very (very) simplistic way, all of these models advocate for autonomous, self-organized small teams, partly to avoid them getting into each other's way, but also because they're are usually more [productive and accountable than larger groups](https://blog.doist.com/small-team-collaboration/?utm_source=madoke.org).

However, each company is different and the conditions to thrive too, which why in a lot of cases we see them falling short, not working as expected. Speaking of self-organizing teams only, what seems to be the most common problem, is that even though they might be structured into clear different domains, autonomy is not always possible either because the product is requires deliverables by multiple teams (e.g app team and api team) or it relies on cross team services (e.g infrastructure or billing), which need to evolve in order to meet the requirements for a specific feature.

Big companies like Google and Amazon built their way standalone teams to support hundreds of products, achieving a state of maturity that is an generally an exception. Most companies will reach the scale up stage with only one product to support and an in-development technical stack that “will one day” allow teams to build their own products in a self-service fashioned way.

Even for those that eventually reach that state, there will be projects that require two or more teams to work together, and that's usually where [the model fails](https://studiorupt.com/the-self-organizing-leadership-paradox/?utm_source=madoke.org) because the sum of several self-organizing teams isn't usually a self-organizing group of teams. And if we think about it, the typical agile teams are built in a way that prioritizes their own process and roadmap over external interference. While this might not always be true, I believe that the hive mind expectation that the self-organized teams will make the best decisions won't work here, because as humans in a group, we tend for someone else to take the first steps and assume the lead. When combined with the teams' individual roadmap, the collective initiative is likely to get second priority. Quoting Amazon SVP Dave Limp: “The best way to fail at inventing something is by making it somebody's part-time job."

We're probably never going to find a one size fits all solution but at this point it is clear that some [some of those models failed](https://www.chameleon.io/blog/spotify-squads?utm_source=madoke) and others [evolved to something else](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/when-jeff-bezoss-two-pizza-teams-fell-short-he-turned-to-brilliant-model-amazon-uses-today.html?utm_source=madoke.org) in order to find a better tradeoff between collaboration and autonomy. Standalone team models are still in my opinion a good way to scale tech organizations, and they work perfectly for most of their working streams, but lead to leadership gaps that increase with the number of dependencies. In order to get things done and deliver these initiatives sucessfully we need these organization models to be flexible enough to allow temporary cross team leadership overrrides that drive teams the same direction, without affecting their boundaries and self-organization on business as usual activities.
