The idea of a borderless decentralised currency remains a very romantic one, but we are yet to see the global adoption. After almost 15 years of bitcoin, rather than taking over central banks, crypto seems to be filling different gaps in economies around the world.

After the recent scandals, namely the [FTX downfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX), and the US regulators [choking crypto businesses](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/print/operation-choke-point-2-0-how-u-s-regulators-fight-bitcoin-with-financial-censorship-), there was a massive purge in the industry. VC money mostly [shifted from crypto to AI](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-is-killing-crypto-venture-capital-interest) and [adoption is down overall](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/) in developed countries, which already have an accessible offer of banking services.

## End user adoption is low

Even with the rising inflation and an economic recession on the corner, in places like the US, UK or EU there isn’t an incentive strong enough to push people away from their financial system:

- **Entry barriers are high**: Setting up a crypto wallet and sending and receiving tokens requires more effort when compared to using Revolut, Wise or Monzo, for example. Moreover, people are used to pay everything in a single domestic currency, which confuses them when introducing a new one. It’s way more natural to charge $10 for a beer than 0.000028 BTC, for example;
- **Lack of solid regulation**: Despite [significant developments in the EU and the US](https://www.investopedia.com/cryptocurrency-regulations-around-the-world-5202122), we’re yet to see properly established regulation frameworks that can level crypto with other financial instruments and are clear to users, especially in what regards to tax;
- **Banks are relatively safe:** Even with all the power exercised by banks and governments, it is safe to have money on the bank in [most developed countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/developed-countries). Most [deposits in the EU are protected](https://n26.com/en-eu/blog/deposit-protection-why-your-money-is-protected) by legislation, and the same in the [US with the FDIC and credit unions](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/is-my-money-safe-in-the-bank/);
- **Not ready for payments:** The existing payments industry is tightly coupled with banking and we don’t have yet the right tools to make it easier and cheap for any merchant to accept crypto payments;

All things considered, banking is still pretty much a no brainer because it’s accessible and effective. The end users don’t care about blockchain, bitcoin or whatever technology holds their money, as long as it’s easy to use and reliable.

## Financial institutions are pushing forward

At the same time, as the finance industry responds by improving their products and expanding their catalogue, institutions are starting to adopt and integrate crypto assets both on the technology stack, and as part of their offer:

- **Regulated investment assets:** With the improvements in regulation, big asset managers like Grayscale and Blackrock are starting to [get into digital asset markets](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/07/why-institutional-allocation-to-crypto-is-on-the-rise/). 2024 should see a major flow of institutional money into crypto after the [upcoming spot bitcoin and crypto](https://www.reuters.com/markets/how-close-are-crypto-markets-first-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-2023-11-20/) ETFs are approved;
- **Enabling faster settlements:** Today’s money transactions are very slow. Most payments might seem instant to the end user but that’s just because one of the parties is bearing the liability. Several apps like Strike, PayPal, Circle Pay or BitPay are already using blockchain technology (lightning network and stable coins) behind the scenes to improve their settlement speeds, allowing them to relax the liability checks that usually happen ahead of the transaction/payment;
- **Transfers between institutions:** Whenever a payment is made, there are usually several transactions between different institutions like card issuers, banks, payment acquirers or any other entity taking part in the business. Not only those transactions are also slow, but also there need to be a lot of controls in place for these institutions to trust each other. Stable coins can play a key role here, not just to improve speeds but also to provide a shared audit trail that simplifies trust between all of them. [Visa](https://investor.visa.com/news/news-details/2023/Visa-Expands-Stablecoin-Settlement-Capabilities-to-Merchant-Acquirers/default.aspx) and [Paypal](https://pyusd.mirror.xyz/Ss1e0V8A01CA3YFkayridGSYNhvOwK8norKFmdo61DQ?utm_source=pocket_saves) are two of the companies experimenting with stable coins for this purpose;
- **Decentralized Finance:** Although there is still a long way to go on the regulatory side, DeFi is still on the rise, with platforms like Compound, AAVE or Curve offering new financial products with better interest than bonds or savings accounts. We expect some of these companies to become fully regulated at some point, however, institutions like [JP Morgan are already adding similar products to their offer](https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/content-hub/institutional-defi);

## Final Remarks

Bitcoin was built to be a fair economic system that provides its users with cheap and borderless payments and a deflationary currency, while at the same time being uncontrollable by any individual or institution. While this anti-system idea is still pretty much alive among bitcoiners, a lot has happened since the release of the original whitepaper. It inspired the entire cryptocurrency industry we have today, where blockchain experiments being run in almost every sector.

However, there is still a big gap between blockchains and the actual consumer products that would eventually enable mass adoption. End users only care about the usability and reliability of their financial system, rather than the technology that powers it.

In weak economies, even with the entry barriers, there are more people using cryptocurrency mostly because they don’t have access to banking or a reliable medium of exchange.

In the developed world, the financial industry was able to fight back with regulations and better banking products, retaining the majority of users. Cryptocurrencies, are making their way into this industry, mostly in the form of speculation vehicle, but also on the technological side, with banks and financial institutions looking into using blockchains to increase settlement speeds, security and the audit trail of their existing products.

Pretty much like banking and currencies aren’t the same in different parts of the world, cryptocurrencies are filling different gaps in economies, while at the same time offering a competitive alternative to existing financial instruments. Although it’s not straightforward, my general opinion is that cryptocurrencies are pushing the financial industry forward, rather than turning it over.
